# Medi-Find
The purpose of this application is to help users find nearby medical stores that have their desired medicines available, along with details such as price and discounts, while also allowing them to manage their personal dosage schedule efficiently.

This system aims to simplify medicine tracking and accessibility through two main modules:

🩺 Medicine Finder:

Users can search for any medicine by name.

The app displays nearby medical stores where the medicine is available.

Each result includes price, discount, and availability details.

Helps users compare and choose the best option quickly.

💊 Dosage Management:

Users can input their weekly tablet schedule (medicine name, dosage time, and day).

The system automatically organizes and displays a daily plan showing which medicine to take and when.

Reduces the risk of missing or repeating doses.

The application provides a secure login system using Supabase, ensuring that each user’s medicine history and dosage data remain private and accessible only to them.
